\section{Evaluation}

In this section we present the results obtained for both CPU and GPU
implementations and analyze the speedup obtained with the optimizations
described in Section~\ref{sec:op_strategies}.

The GPU cards used were GeForce GTX 480 of from Nvidia (Fermi architecture)
having 1.5 GB of total memory and 15 multiprocessors each with 32 cores
operating at a clock speed of 1.4 GHz. An important observation to make is that
the device suports CUDA Capability 2.0 which, among other features, includes the
possibility for the same on-chip memory to be used for both L1 cache and shared
memory. It can be configured as either 48 KB of shared memory and 16 KB of L1
cache or as 16 KB of shared memory and 48 KB of L1 cache. We used the second
option for the \textit{evaluation} algorithm in order to cache the accesses to
local and global memory and also temporary register spills.

For compilation, we used Cuda Toolkit 4.1 with flags ``-arch=sm\_20''.

\section{Related Work}
A compact data structure and efficient in-place algorithms for regular sparse
grids were presented in \cite{murarasu2011} and further extended to support
adaptive sparse grids on CPUs in \cite{murarasu2012}. In this paper we start
from these basic algorithms for adaptive sparse grids and implement new ones for
GPUs. In addition, we present a set of loop transformations for both CPUs and
GPUS.

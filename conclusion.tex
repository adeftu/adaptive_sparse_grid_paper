\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we presented a series of loop transformations and showed
how they behave on CPUs and GPUs when applied to a computational steering
application. We argued that giving the architectural similitude of CPUs and GPUs
seen both as vector processors with different vector units sizes and roughly
same cache hierachy, some optimizations, at least conceptually, should be the
same. With these concepts in mind, we proposed an extensive set of optimizations
for both CPUs and GPUs that provide a speedup of up to 12.8x and 5.2x
respectively.

In addition, we presented the first implementation of interpolation
using the adaptive sparse grids technique on GPUs.
